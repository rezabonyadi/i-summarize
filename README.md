This is an attempt to use multiple technologies for summarizing meetings out of videos:

- Take the meeting audio out of the meeting recording
- Recognize different speakers from their audio and prepare profile for each (this does not exist, I am building those)
- Use speech to text to convert the audio to script
- Use Text summarization tools (Bart/T5) to summarize scripts
